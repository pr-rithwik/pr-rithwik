# Ratan Rithwik | AI/ML Engineer

> **AI/ML Engineer with deep expertise in full-stack development and a specialization in Generative AI.** I architect and build end-to-end systems, leveraging technologies like LangChain, RAG, and fine-tuning to create intelligent applications. My project work includes developing everything from classic collaborative filtering engines to advanced NLP pipelines for real-world business problems.

### Featured Projects

Here are the foundational projects from my recent R&D phase, where I focused on deep analysis and establishing robust baselines for full-stack ML systems.

*   **[Intelligent Review Analytics Platform](https://github.com/pr-rithwik/intelligent-review-analytics)**
    *   A deep-dive analysis establishing the data pipeline and a baseline model (Logistic Regression) for sentiment classification. This project serves as the documented foundation for a future full-stack business intelligence tool.
    *   **Status:** `Phase 1 Complete - Baseline model and analysis established.`

*   **[Comparative Analysis of Recommendation Engines](https://github.com/pr-rithwik/netflix-recommendation-engine)**
    *   A reproducible Jupyter Notebook comparing the performance of multiple collaborative filtering algorithms (KNN, SVD, NMF) on a benchmark dataset, focusing on the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and interpretability.
    *   **Status:** `Analysis Complete.`
