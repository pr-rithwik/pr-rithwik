# Ratan Rithwik | AI/ML Engineer

> **AI/ML Engineer with deep expertise in full-stack development and a specialization in Generative AI.** I architect and build end-to-end systems, leveraging technologies like LangChain, RAG, and fine-tuning to create intelligent applications. My project work includes developing everything from classic collaborative filtering engines to advanced NLP pipelines for real-world business problems.

### ðŸ”­ Currently Building

My current focus is on building end-to-end portfolio projects that demonstrate the full lifecycle of ML systemsâ€”from robust data processing to interactive, full-stack deployment.

*   **[Intelligent Review Analytics Platform](https://github.com/pr-rithwik/intelligent-review-analytics)**
    *   An NLP pipeline and interactive dashboard for sentiment classification and business intelligence on e-commerce reviews.
    *   **Status:** `In Development - Finalizing model pipeline and deploying Streamlit UI.`

*   **[Netflix Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/pr-rithwik/netflix-recommendation-engine)**
    *   A full-stack application to benchmark and serve multiple recommendation algorithms (KNN, SVD, NMF) in real-time.
    *   **Status:** `Proof-of-Concept - Actively refactoring and preparing for v2 upgrade.`

*   **[Deep Dive Recommenders](https://github.com/pr-rithwik/deep-dive-recommenders)**
    *   I am currently architecting the next version of this system, which will leverage a richer, real-world dataset to deliver more impactful and realistic recommendations.
