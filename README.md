## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ratan Rithwik

Aspiring Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on practical, end-to-end ML solutions. I build and experiment with supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models using Python and high-level libraries like Scikit-learn, NumPy, and PyTorch.

My projects emphasize clear evaluation, reproducibility, and real-world relevance â€” from imputation and clustering to recommendation systems and agent-based learning.
